### Finding the kth smallest integer in a set of integers
#### Algorithm #1
```
Procedure1 SELECT(k, S) { 
    if size(S)==1 then return the single element in S
    else  { 
        choose an element a randomly from S;
        let S1,S2,and S3 be he sequences of elements in S less than, equal to, and greater than m, respectively;
        if IS1I >=k then return SELECT(k,S1)
        else if IS1I + IS2I >=k then return m
        else  return SELECT(k-IS1I-IS2I , S3);
    }
} 
```
This algorithm has worse case complexity Θ (n2) and average complexity Θ(n). The next slide shows an algorithm with a linear complexity. 
#### Algorithm #2
```
Procedure 2 SELECT(k,S) {
    if ISI < 50 then { 
        sort S; 
        return the kth smallest element;
    }
    else { 
        divide S into ISI/5 sequences of 5 elements each with up to four leftover elements;
        sort each 5-element sequence;
        let M be the sequence of the medians of the 5-element sets;
        let m= SELECT(│M│/2, M); 
        let S1, S2,  and  S3 be he sequences of elements in S less than, equal to, and greater than m, respectively;
        if IS1I >=k then return SELECT(k,S1)
        else if (IS1I + IS2I >= k) then return m
        else  return SELECT(k-IS1I-IS2I , S3); 
    }
}
```

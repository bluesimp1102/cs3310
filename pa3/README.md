## Programming Assignment #3

A board has `n*m` cells, and each cell has a value (positive or negative). The game is to `start from the top-left cell`, and move `right` or `down` or `diagonal` in each step, and `finally reach the cell at the bottom-right cell`. The objective is to `find the maximum total values you may earn` and to `find a route that generates the maximum`. Use the dynamic programming to model, program this problem, and compute its time complexity. Test your program using several data sets generated by a random number generator.

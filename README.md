# Welcome to my Git Repo for the algorithms course!

## READ ME!
This repository contains my implementations of the course's various algorithms and data structures. I'm sharing this code to provide a resource for others to roast, look at, comment on, and share their thoughts on. I have no intention of using this code to break any academic rules or to promote any form of cheating.

## CPP CS3310 - Course Description:
The course covers algorithms for fundamental problems, such as efficiency analysis using asymptotic notation, primary algorithm design techniques and their tradeoffs, NP-theory, and approaches to dealing with intractability. Students should be able to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using O, Ω, and Θ notation, use different algorithms for a given problem, design algorithms using divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods, understand selected graph algorithms, and use branch and bound and backtracking methods for problem-solving by the end of the course.

## What you can find here?
In this repository, you will find implementations of algorithms and data structures that we have covered in the course. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and is contained in its own file. I have tried my best to include detailed comments in each file to explain the logic behind the algorithm and how it works.

***Please feel free to comment on any of the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. I hope that this code is helpful to those who are studying algorithms or simply interested in learning more about them.***

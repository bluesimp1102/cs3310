# Welcome to my Git Repo for the algorithms course!

## READ ME!
This repository contains my implementation of various algorithms and data structures covered in the course. I am sharing this code with the intention of providing a resource for others to roast, look at, comment on, and share their thoughts. I have no intention of using this code to violate any academic rules or to promote cheating in any way.

## CPP CS3310 - Course Description:
The course covers algorithms for fundamental problems, including efficiency analysis using asymptotic notation, principal algorithm design techniques and their tradeoffs, NP-theory, and approaches used to address intractability. By the end of the course, students should be able to analyze time and space complexity of algorithms using O, Ω, and Θ notation, employ different algorithms for a given problem, design algorithms using divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods, understand selected graph algorithms, and use branch and bound and backtracking methods for problem-solving.

## What you can find here?
In this repository, you will find implementations of algorithms and data structures that we have covered in the course. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and is contained in its own file. I have included detailed comments in each file to explain the logic behind the algorithm and how it works.

**Please feel free to comment on any of the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. I hope that this code is helpful to those who are studying algorithms or simply interested in learning more about them.**

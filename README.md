# Welcome to my Git Repo for the algorithms course!

## READ ME!
This repository contains my implementations of the course's various algorithms and data structures. I'm sharing this code to provide a resource for others to roast, look at, comment on, and share their thoughts on. I have no intention of using this code to break any academic rules or to promote any form of cheating.

## CS Course - Design and Analysis of Algorithms:
The course covers algorithms for fundamental problems, such as efficiency analysis using asymptotic notation, primary algorithm design techniques and their tradeoffs, NP-theory, and approaches to dealing with intractability. Students should be able to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using O, Ω, and Θ notation, use different algorithms for a given problem, design algorithms using divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods, understand selected graph algorithms, and use branch and bound and backtracking methods for problem-solving by the end of the course.

## What you can find here?
This repository contains my implementations of algorithms and data structures covered in the course. Each algorithm is written in Python and stored in its own file. I've done my best to include detailed comments in each file that explain the algorithm's logic and how it works.

***Please feel free to leave comments, provide feedback, or suggest improvements on any of the code. I hope this code is useful to those who are studying algorithms or are simply curious about them.***
